Refer to little_specs.txt for the initial view I had in mind for the game.
Below is a copy of it.

================
little_specs.txt
================
- Three screens: game, scores, menu.
- Menu screen leads you to one of the other two screens.
- Scores screen tells you the scores or that there aren't any. There will also
be an arrow for going back.
- Game screen is for playing the game. The game shouldn't start right away.
- Before starting, game asks player to "click the screen" and then game will
start.
- There will be the main panel for the tetris game and a 'next piece' on the
side.
- Pieces will come at random.
- <space> flips a piece.
- up, down, left, right are used to move a piece.
- Two fast paced <down> hits will drop the piece (make it go 'as fast as'
possible downwards).
- On top of the tetris panel, there will be your current points and a max
score on the side for you to compare with.
- A score is a combination of in-game points and time to complete those
points.
- Data structures are organized per screen. There are MainScreen, GameScreen
and ScoreScreen. They should be self contained in the sense that all computing
going on while in the score screen should only use data in the DS ScoreScreen.

Note: This is a rough spec about the code and the game that was written before
any code. It's being done done in half an hour or so and it won't be changed
after now. This will serve as a comparison point for the end of this first
stage of the game. For more information, see the code.

===========================================
Point-by-Point Analysis of little_specs.txt
===========================================
The game has three screens as planned, and indeed the menu screen leads you
to the other two screens. The scores screen behaves differently than what
was predicted. When no scores were recorded, then it's pretty much a 'blank'
panel. To go back, you don't have an arrow image, you hit ESC. The fact that
there is no text for when there are no recorded scores is a bug.

The game screen is for playing the game. The game does start right away, which
is another bug. The next piece on the side was implemented and it works just
fine. Pieces do come at random, but it's the up arrow key that flips the piece,
which seems way better than having the space bar do it. Moving the piece up
was a bug in the specification. That's not something you can do in tetris
games.

The two fast hits to the down arrow key doesn't make it drop. Holding the down
arrow key will make it go faster though. This seems like a better feature to
have than having the drop. But having the drop instead would make the game
harder it seems. I'll leave this as is.

The game screen doesn't show you the max score for you to compare with. That is
a bug.

The specification had something to say about the data structures used in the
game. This is a bug in it. It shouldn't be talking about such matters.

=============
Current Specs
=============
While little_specs.txt was a rough requirements document. This, however is a
report on what characteristics the game actually has. It's a document built by
analyzing what was really built.

- There are three screens: MENU, SCORES and GAME.
- At the beginning of the game or right after the transition from a screen
to another, the tetris music should re-start.
- Music plays in an infinite loop.
- Theme song is the classic tetris theme song.
- All screens have a static simple black and white pixelart-ish stars
background.
- The game starts at the MENU screen.
- To quit the game, you hit the X button on your window. Some underlying
shortcut can also be used (like ALT+F4 on linux/xfce4). There is no in-game
sure-fire way to close the game (like hitting ESC on the MENU screen).

- The MENU screen has a title and two buttons to lead each to the other two
screens.

- The SCORES screen shows the recorded high scores of the session (from game
beginning to closing the game).
- Scores aren't remembered through game sessions.
- When there aren't any scores, the SCORES screen will only show the
background, a title and the help text telling the player how to go back.
- Hitting ESC goes back form the SCORES screen to the MENU screen.
- Only the top 5 scores are shown.

- During the game play, pieces do seen to come randomly. Sometimes it feels
like the game is against you, but it also feels like it's helping you some
other times.
- There is nothing before hitting "new game" and the game starting. The player
doesn't have to click anywhere or do anything. The game starts right after
the player going into the GAME screen.
- When the player loses, the game just goes back to the MENU screen. There is
no "Game Over" or no indication that your score is now in the top 5, or that
it's a new global record.
- There is no animation or sound effect when a line is cleared during the game.
- You can control the piece with up, down, left and right. Using the up arrow
key will flip the piece. Using the down arrow key will make it move faster
downwards, but it won't drop it right away.
- If you clear more lines at once, there are more points to be made. If you
clear those lines higher in the pieces panel, then yet more points are to be
made: clearing 1 and the first line makes you 1 point; clearing 4 lines above
at once will give you 96 points.
  - Clearing N lines: N*2^(N-1)*P where P is the position modifier.
  - For bottom, P is 1; middle, P=2; above, P=3.
  - So for N=3 in the middle: 3*2^2*2 = 3*8 = 24.

Some of the emphasis on this list is bringing into the foreground things I
think were a mistake and things I think were done well. For example:

Mistakes:

- No animation or sound effect when clearing lines.
- Static background. It should be animated.
- Game starts without prompting the player. No indication of how the particular
play affected your scores.
- Nothing but going back to the MENU screen happens when you lose.
- Scores aren't persisted.
- Soundtrack restarts at the beginning of every screen.
- No levels. The game doesn't get more difficult in any way.

Rights:

- Points system. It encourages you to try going for 4 lines at once above the
middle ground. It makes the game riskier (more interesting then).
- Down button doesn't drop the piece right away. This is a deviation from
little_specs.txt, but I think this turned out to be a better thing to do.

The rights also include all the places in which the actual spec was in sync
with what a tetris game should do and with what was expected for the game in
the first place (see little_specs.txt). For example, it's a right that when you
have a filled row, it disappears and you score. But it's not useful specifying
all of those cases because then this list would be huge.

Things I'm not sure if were rights or wrongs:

- In no point, the scoring system is explained to the player. This gives an
advantage to the more observant player (that sees way more points being made
by clearing more rows). It also adds a "secondary puzzle", which is breaking
down the rules for scoring.
- Only 5, and not 10, or 3, top scores.
- No speeding up as the game progress.

============================
Difficulty in Playing Tetris
============================
One of the ways in which I said I made a mistake was:

  "No levels. The game doesn't get more difficult in any way."

Also, a characteristic which I don't know if I did it right or not was:

  "No speeding up as the game progress."

These may seem conflicting, but they're actually not. There are different ways
to make tetris more difficult:

- Restricting how many times a piece may be flipped (3 for most difficulty).
- Increasing the speed in which a piece falls.
- Increasing the "cooldown" of a flip action (as of now, you can flip as
much and as fast as you can hit the up arrow key).
- Slowing how fast you can move the piece horizontally.
- Increasing how fast the piece falls when you hit the downwards arrow key.
- Having an AI that picks pieces that will purposely hurt your game.
- Dropping blocks which can't be cleared.

And many more...
