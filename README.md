Tetris Clone in C and SDL2
==========================

A tetris clone to practice SDL2, game development and C.

The game, as currently is, is a finished first version. You should be able to
run the game by running the `make build` and then `./main`.

I've blogged about the game. The post constains some relevant information
about this project. If you're interested, [check it out](http://personalphao.wordpress.com/2014/11/30/tetris-clone-in-c-and-sdl2/).
The contents of the posts including the retrospectives are all in here. Check
the files: `little_specs.txt`, `retrospective.txt` and
`retrospective_impl.txt`.

For now, I won't be updating this project. My next steps are:

- Making a C++ rewrite to see how better (or worse) it'd look.
- Refactoring this code to make a better C implementation.
- Add some features to the game, including an animated background and an
animation for when a line is cleared.
