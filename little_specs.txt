- Three screens: game, scores, menu.
- Menu screen leads you to one of the other two screens.
- Scores screen tells you the scores or that there aren't any. There will also
be an arrow for going back.
- Game screen is for playing the game. The game shouldn't start right away.
- Before starting, game asks player to "click the screen" and then game will
start.
- There will be the main panel for the tetris game and a 'next piece' on the
side.
- Pieces will come at random.
- <space> flips a piece.
- up, down, left, right are used to move a piece.
- Two fast paced <down> hits will drop the piece (make it go 'as fast as'
possible downwards).
- On top of the tetris panel, there will be your current points and a max
score on the side for you to compare with.
- A score is a combination of in-game points and time to complete those
points.
- Data structures are organized per screen. There are MainScreen, GameScreen
and ScoreScreen. They should be self contained in the sense that all computing
going on while in the score screen should only use data in the DS ScoreScreen.

Note: This is a rough spec about the code and the game that was written before
any code. It's being done done in half an hour or so and it won't be changed
after now. This will serve as a comparison point for the end of this first
stage of the game. For more information, see the code.
